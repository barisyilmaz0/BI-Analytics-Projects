| 1 | [AirBnb Project](https://github.com/barisyilmaz0/BI-Analytics-Projects/tree/main/AirBnb%20Project) | This project analyzes Airbnb data to identify high-performing neighborhoods in New York City based on revenue and customer engagement (measured by number of reviews). Findings show that neighborhoods like the Lower East Side, Hellâ€™s Kitchen, and Harlem generate the most revenue and receive strong customer interest, making them ideal areas for property expansion. While one-bedroom units are most common across the city, Midtown stands out with a higher demand for studios. Based on these insights, the strategy focuses on adding more one-bedroom units in Harlem and the Lower East Side, and increasing studio offerings in Midtown. Additionally, analyzing guest reviews can help improve listings, especially in areas like the Upper East Side and West Village, where lower review counts may be limiting customer attraction. |
