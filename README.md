# BI-Analytics-Projects 
Portfolio of completed projects I worked on while attending the BI Analytics TripleTen Bootcamp.

| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | [AirBnb Project](https://github.com/barisyilmaz0/BI-Analytics-Projects/tree/main/AirBnb%20Project) | This project analyzes Airbnb data to identify high-performing neighborhoods in New York City based on revenue and customer engagement (measured by number of reviews). Findings show that neighborhoods like the Lower East Side, Hellâ€™s Kitchen, and Harlem generate the most revenue and receive strong customer interest, making them ideal areas for property expansion. While one-bedroom units are most common across the city, Midtown stands out with a higher demand for studios. Based on these insights, the strategy focuses on adding more one-bedroom units in Harlem and the Lower East Side, and increasing studio offerings in Midtown. Additionally, analyzing guest reviews can help improve listings, especially in areas like the Upper East Side and West Village, where lower review counts may be limiting customer attraction. |
| 2 | [zomato cuisine](PROJECT DIRECTORY LINK) | This project explores cuisine performance across cities by analyzing sales, diversity, and pricing data. Key insights reveal that North Indian salads consistently lead in average sales, indicating a strong customer preference for healthy yet familiar regional dishes. The analysis of cuisine distribution across cities shows that Afghan cuisine outperforms African cuisine in terms of presence and performance, highlighting its wider acceptance in urban markets. Additionally, a scatter plot of cuisine types versus average pricing shows that American and Mediterranean cuisines strike a favorable balance between cost and customer appeal, suggesting they are perceived as offering strong value across different price points. |
